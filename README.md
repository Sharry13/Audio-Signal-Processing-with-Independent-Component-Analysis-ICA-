# Audio-Signal-Processing-with-Independent-Component-Analysis-ICA-

In this notebook, we'll use Independent Component Analysis to retrieve original signals from three observations each of which contains a different mix of the original signals. This is the same problem explained in the ICA video.

# Dataset

Let's begin by looking at the dataset we have. We have five WAVE files, each of which is a mix, as we've mentioned. If you haven't worked with audio files in python before, that's okay, they basically boil down to being lists of floats.
